      "The issue you're encountering, \"invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase,\" is typically due to how Windows handles volume mappings with Docker. The repository names in Docker must be in lowercase. You can try the following solutions to fix this issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ensure your file paths do not contain spaces.\n",
      "   - Move your data to a folder without spaces. For example:\n",
      "     - If your code is in `C:/Users/Alexey Grigorev/git/...`, move it to `C:/git/...`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Try replacing the `-v` part with one of the following options in your Docker command:\n",
      "   - `-v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\n",
      "   - `-v //c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\n",
      "   - `-v /c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\n",
      "   - `-v //c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\n",
      "   - `--volume //driveletter/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data`\n",
      "\n",
      "3. If you are using `winpty`, try adding `winpty` before the Docker command:\n",
      "   ```shell\n",
      "   winpty docker run -it -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" -e POSTGRES_DB=\"ny_taxi\" -v /c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 postgres:1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Try adding quotes around the volume mapping:\n",
      "   - `-v \"/c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\n",
      "   - `-v \"//c:/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\n",
      "   - `-v \"/c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\n",
      "   - `-v \"//c/some/path/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"`\n",
      "   - `-v \"c:\\some\\path\\ny_taxi_postgres_data\":/var/lib/postgresql/data`\n",
      "\n",
      "5. If a folder gets automatically created named like `ny_taxi_postgres_data;C`, it suggests issues with volume mapping. Try deleting both folders and replacing the `-v` part with other options mentioned above. For some setups, `//c/` works instead of `/c/`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Using the current directory (`pwd`) in quotes might work:\n",
      "   ```shell\n",
      "   -v \"/$(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "7. As an alternative, use a volume name instead of a path:\n",
      "   ```shell\n",
      "   -v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",

      "If you are experiencing issues connecting to Postgres on port 5432 and your password is not working, there are a few potential solutions you can try:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Port Conflict**:\n",
      "   - It is possible that the port 5432 is already being used by another Postgres instance on your machine.\n",
      "   - Try substituting port 5432 with another port like 5431 in your connection URL.\n",

      "     ```\n",
      "     \n",
      "2. **Checking Running Services (Windows)**:\n",
      "   - You may have a service running on your machine that is causing a conflict. Stop any local Postgres service that is running on your machine if you have Postgres installed locally.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Database User and Password**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that you are using the correct username and password for your Postgres instance. If \"root\" is not a valid username in your Postgres setup, you might face authentication errors. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Stop and Restart Docker Compose**:\n",
      "   - If these steps don't resolve the issue, you could try stopping and restarting your Docker Compose setup. Sometimes this helps to reset the configuration:\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     docker compose down\n",
      "     # Optionally, remove the Postgres volume\n",

      "     docker compose up\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Additional Debugging (MacOS)**:\n",
      "   - To find out if something is blocking your port, use the `lsof` command:\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     lsof -i :5432\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - To list the running Postgres services on your local machine with `launchctl`:\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     sudo launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist\n",
      "     # To start it again\n",
      "     sudo launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist\n",
      "     ```\n",

      "Make sure Postgres is running by checking the running docker containers:\n",
      "```sh\n",
      "docker ps\n",
